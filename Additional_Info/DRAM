🧪 DRAM Functional Annotation Notes
🧬 Overview
DRAM is a powerful tool for functional annotation of microbial genomes or MAGs. It integrates multiple databases (KEGG, UniRef, Pfam, etc.) to assign metabolic functions and identify important genes like transporters, enzymes, and secondary metabolite pathways.

This step is key for:
Exploring the metabolic potential of MAGs
Identifying genes involved in drought tolerance, stress response, or plant-microbe interactions
Linking taxonomy to function

📁 Input Requirements
A directory of MAGs in FASTA format (same as for GTDB-Tk)
High-quality MAGs (ideally filtered by CheckM or similar tools)

🚀 Running DRAM (Standard Annotation)
bash
Copy
Edit
dram.py annotate \
  -i /path/to/MAGs/*.fa \
  -o /path/to/FunctionAnnotation \
  --threads 8 \
  --min_contig_size 1000
-i: Input MAG files (FASTA format)
-o: Output directory
--threads: Number of CPU threads
--min_contig_size: Optional; filters out small contigs
