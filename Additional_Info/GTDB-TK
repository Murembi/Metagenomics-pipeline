Overview
GTDB-Tk (Genome Taxonomy Database Toolkit) is used to assign standardized, phylogenetically consistent taxonomy to bacterial and archaeal genomes, including MAGs from metagenomic datasets.

This step is crucial for:
Identifying the species/genus of each MAG
Comparing microbial diversity across environments
Linking taxonomy to ecological functions or traits

⚙️ Input Requirements
A directory of MAGs in FASTA format
Each MAG should be a single .fasta or .fa file (with contigs)
File names should be unique (e.g., MAG_001.fa, MAG_002.fa, etc.

classify_wf: runs the full classification workflow
--genome_dir: folder with input FASTA files
--out_dir: destination for results
--cpus: number of cores to use
